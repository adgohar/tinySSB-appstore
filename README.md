# tinySSB - the LoRa descendant of Secure Scuttlebutt

![tinySSB logo](doc/_img/tinySSB-banner.png)

## Overview

The current tinySSB demonstrator for Android (based on Kotlin and JavaScript and used for student projects) only supports statically defined extensions ("apps"). The goal of this project is to build an app-store-like infrastructure such that extensions can be dynamically loaded and executed. Using append-only logs as software distribution mechanism, a prototype for a decentral app-store should be build.
